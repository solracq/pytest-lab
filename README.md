# Pytest Lab
=============
This repository contains pytest-based automation examples and experiments focused on practicing and refining test automation techniques in Python.

The goal of this repository is deliberate experimentation rather than tutorial-driven learning. It explores:
- Pytest fundamentals and advanced features
- Test structuring, fixtures, and parametrization
- Writing maintainable, readable, and scalable automated tests
- Experimenting with patterns commonly used in API and system-level automation

The examples may evolve over time as approaches are refined or new patterns are explored.

This repository serves as a personal automation lab to strengthen pytest-based testing practices.
